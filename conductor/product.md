## Configuration

Configuration is done through two main files:

1. `config/config.ini` - General configuration options
2. `config/credentials.ini` - API tokens and passwords

You can use the built-in configuration utility:
```bash
python scripts/configure.py
```

Or edit the files directly (see the example files for available options).

### Getting a Nuki API Token

1. Log in to the [Nuki Web Dashboard](https://web.nuki.io/)
2. Go to "Account" > "API"
3. Generate a new API token
4. Copy the token into your `credentials.ini` file

### Setting up Telegram Notifications

1. Create a new Telegram bot using [BotFather](https://t.me/botfather)
2. Get your bot token and add it to `credentials.ini`
3. Run the utility to get your chat ID:
   ```bash
   python scripts/get_telegram_chat_id.py
   ```
4. Add the chat ID to your `config.ini` file

## Web Interface

The web interface provides a user-friendly way to manage your Nuki lock notifications:

- **Dashboard**: View current lock status and recent activity
- **Activity**: Browse complete activity history
- **Status**: Check the current status of all your locks
- **Temporary Codes**: Create and manage temporary access codes (admin and agent roles)
- **Configuration**: Adjust notification settings (admin only)
- **User Management**: Add and manage users (admin only)
- **Notification Settings**: Configure notification preferences (admin only)

Access the web interface at `http://your-pi-ip:5000`

### User Roles

The system supports two types of user roles:

1. **Admin**: Full access to all features and settings
2. **Agent**: Restricted access for managing temporary codes and viewing basic lock information

#### Creating Agent Users

To create an agent user with the ability to manage temporary access codes:

1. Log in as an admin user
2. Go to Admin → Create Agent User
3. Fill in the required information
4. Click "Create Agent User"

The agent role provides limited dashboard access focused primarily on temporary code management.

#### Managing Temporary Codes

To create a temporary access code:

1. Log in as an admin or agent user
2. Go to the "Temporary Codes" page
3. Fill in the code, name/purpose, and expiry date/time
4. Click "Create Temporary Code"

Temporary codes will automatically expire at the set time.

## Security Features

- Secure storage of API credentials
- HTTPS support for the web interface
- Role-based access control
- Proper password hashing
- Security event detection
- Activity anomaly monitoring

## Docker Deployment Guidelines

For detailed information about Docker deployment, including important information about container permissions and bind mounts, please refer to the [DOCKER_SETUP.md](DOCKER_SETUP.md) document.

### Important: Host Directory Permissions for Docker

When using Docker, the containers run as a non-root user (`nuki` with UID 999). This means the host directories mounted into the container must have appropriate permissions:

```bash
# Create directories if they don't exist
mkdir -p config logs data

# Set directory permissions (Linux/macOS only)
chmod 777 config
chmod -R 777 logs data

# Set config file permissions (if they exist)
chmod 644 config/*.ini
```

These permissions are critical for the application to function correctly. If the container cannot access the config files or write to logs, it will fail to start or operate correctly.

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

### API Authentication Failed (401 Unauthorized)

If you're seeing "401 Unauthorized" errors in the logs:

- Your Nuki API token has likely expired or been revoked
- Generate a new API token using the token manager:
  ```bash
  # If running traditionally:
  python scripts/token_manager.py
  
  # If running in Docker:
  docker exec -it nuki-monitor python scripts/token_manager.py
  ```
- Alternatively, you can edit `config/credentials.ini` directly with your new token
- After updating the token, restart the service or container:
  ```bash
  # For traditional installation:
  sudo systemctl restart nuki-monitor.service
  
  # For Docker installation:
  docker compose restart nuki-monitor
  ```

### Docker Bind Mount Permission Issues

If you're using Docker and see errors like:
- `Permission denied: '/app/config/credentials.ini'`
- `Permission denied: '/app/config/users.json'`
- No notifications despite correct configuration
- Containers crash or restart repeatedly

This indicates a permission issue with the Docker bind mounts. Follow the steps in [DOCKER_SETUP.md](DOCKER_SETUP.md) to fix these issues.

### Web interface not working

- Ensure the web service is running:
  ```bash
  # For traditional installation:
  sudo systemctl status nuki-web.service
  
  # For Docker installation:
  docker ps | grep nuki-web
  ```
- Check for errors in the web logs:
  ```bash
  # For traditional installation:
  tail -f ~/nukiweb/logs/nuki_web.log
  
  # For Docker installation:
  docker logs nuki-web
  ```
- Verify the health status with:
  ```bash
  curl http://your-pi-ip:5000/health
  ```
