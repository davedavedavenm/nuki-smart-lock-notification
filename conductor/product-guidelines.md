# Product Guidelines - Nuki Smart Lock Notification System

## Communication Style
- **Tone**: Helpful and Instructional.
- **Approach**: Prioritize clarity and provide actionable next steps in all user-facing messages. Avoid opaque error messages; instead, explain *why* something happened and *how* the user can fix it (e.g., providing a link to the Nuki Web Dashboard if a token is invalid).

## User Interface (UI) Design
- **Information Density**: The dashboard should be functional and data-rich, providing power users with comprehensive logs and detailed status information at a glance.
- **Minimalist Layout**: Despite the density, maintain a clean and uncluttered aesthetic with consistent spacing and clear hierarchy to prevent cognitive overload.
- **Visual Themes**: Full parity between Light and Dark modes is a core requirement. Every component must be optimized for readability and visual appeal in both themes.
- **Status Indicators**: Use a consistent color language (e.g., Green for locked/healthy, Red for unlocked/error) as primary visual cues for system state.

## Error Handling
- **Actionable Transparency**: Technical errors should be presented with enough detail for troubleshooting (transparent) while remaining accessible (user-friendly).
- **Presentation**: Display errors with clear, non-jargon summaries followed by optional technical details for advanced users.

## Documentation Strategy
- **User-Centric**: Prioritize hand-written, descriptive 'how-to' guides in the 'docs/' directory.
- **Content**: Focus on practical scenarios, installation walkthroughs, and common troubleshooting steps rather than exhaustive, low-level technical specifications.

## Visual Identity
- **Utility-First**: Rely on standard, high-quality UI components (e.g., Bootstrap-based) to ensure a familiar and functional experience.
- **Branding**: The identity is defined by its reliability and utility, focused on clear data visualization rather than custom decorative branding.
