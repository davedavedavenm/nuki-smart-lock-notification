# Nuki Smart Lock Notification System - Enhancement Plan

## Current System Status

The Nuki Smart Lock notification system is fully operational with the following features:

- ✅ Connection to Nuki Web API
- ✅ Regular polling for lock activity
- ✅ User identification in notifications
- ✅ Support for both email and Telegram notifications
- ✅ Smart handling of auto-lock events
- ✅ Configurability via command-line utility
- ✅ Systemd service for automatic startup
- ✅ Proper error handling and logging
- ✅ Secure credential storage
- ✅ Web interface with user management
- ✅ Dark mode implementation
- ✅ Basic Docker implementation
- ✅ Configuration management via web UI

## Planned Enhancements

Based on our discussion, we will implement the following enhancements:

### 1. Full Docker Containerization (Priority: High)

Make the system fully portable and deployable on any platform through complete containerization.

**Features:**
- Self-contained Docker Compose setup
- Automatic configuration bootstrapping
- No manual configuration needed for initial setup
- Cross-platform compatibility (Linux, Windows, macOS)
- Easy backup and restore
- One-command deployment

**Implementation Steps:**
1. Refine Docker Compose configuration
   - Improve volume management
   - Add proper dependency resolution
   - Set up environment variable handling
   - Implement container health checks
2. Create initial setup automation
   - First-run detection and setup
   - Configuration template generation
   - Credential handling for first-time users
3. Develop deployment scripts
   - Platform-specific deployment helpers
   - Health monitoring for containers
   - Update mechanisms
4. Create comprehensive documentation
   - Installation guide for different platforms
   - Command reference
   - Troubleshooting section

**Technologies:**
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Shell and batch scripting
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD
- Configuration templating

### 2. Failed Attempt Detection (Priority: Medium)

Enhanced security through detection of suspicious activity patterns.

**Features:**
- Detection of multiple failed unlock attempts
- Alerts for unusual access patterns
- Configurable sensitivity
- Special notification format for security alerts

**Implementation Steps:**
1. Add tracking for failed attempts in API module
2. Implement pattern recognition algorithm
3. Create security alert notification type
4. Add configuration options for sensitivity

### 3. Webhook Support (Priority: Low)

Support for real-time notifications via webhooks if supported by Nuki API.

**Features:**
- Lower latency notifications
- Integration with third-party services
- Support for push notifications to mobile devices
- Potential reduction in API polling requirements

**Implementation Steps:**
1. Research Nuki API webhook capabilities
2. Implement webhook handler
3. Set up secure endpoint for receiving events
4. Add configuration options for webhook URLs
5. Integrate with notification system

## Implementation Timeline

### Phase 1: Full Docker Containerization (1-2 weeks)
- Optimize Docker Compose setup
- Create bootstrapping scripts
- Improve volume management
- Add health check monitoring
- Develop multi-platform deployment guidance

### Phase 2: Failed Attempt Detection (1-2 weeks)
- Track failed attempts
- Implement detection algorithm
- Add security alert notifications

### Phase 3: Web Interface Enhancements (2-3 weeks)
- Add authentication
- Implement statistics and charts
- Improve UI/UX
- Mobile responsive design

### Phase 4: Webhook Support (if applicable) (1-2 weeks)
- Research and implement webhook capabilities
- Add push notification support
