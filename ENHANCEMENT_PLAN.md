# Nuki Smart Lock Notification System - Enhancement Plan

## Current System Status

The Nuki Smart Lock notification system is fully operational with the following features:

- ✅ Connection to Nuki Web API
- ✅ Regular polling for lock activity
- ✅ User identification in notifications
- ✅ Support for both email and Telegram notifications
- ✅ Smart handling of auto-lock events
- ✅ Configurability via command-line utility
- ✅ Systemd service for automatic startup
- ✅ Proper error handling and logging
- ✅ Secure credential storage

## Planned Enhancements

Based on our discussion, we will implement the following enhancements:

### 1. Web Interface (Priority: High)

A web-based dashboard to view and manage the Nuki lock system.

**Features:**
- Activity log viewer
- Real-time status display
- Configuration interface
- User management
- Statistics and analytics

**Implementation Steps:**
1. Set up basic Flask web server
2. Create dashboard UI with Bootstrap
3. Implement API endpoints for data access
4. Create configuration interface
5. Add authentication and security
6. Integrate with existing notification system

**Technologies:**
- Flask (Python web framework)
- Bootstrap (UI framework)
- Chart.js (for statistics visualization)
- SQLite (for activity storage)

### 2. Failed Attempt Detection (Priority: Medium)

Enhanced security through detection of suspicious activity patterns.

**Features:**
- Detection of multiple failed unlock attempts
- Alerts for unusual access patterns
- Configurable sensitivity
- Special notification format for security alerts

**Implementation Steps:**
1. Add tracking for failed attempts in API module
2. Implement pattern recognition algorithm
3. Create security alert notification type
4. Add configuration options for sensitivity

### 3. Webhook Support (Priority: Low)

Support for real-time notifications via webhooks if supported by Nuki API.

**Features:**
- Lower latency notifications
- Integration with third-party services
- Support for push notifications to mobile devices
- Potential reduction in API polling requirements

**Implementation Steps:**
1. Research Nuki API webhook capabilities
2. Implement webhook handler
3. Set up secure endpoint for receiving events
4. Add configuration options for webhook URLs
5. Integrate with notification system

## Implementation Timeline

### Phase 1: Web Interface Basic Implementation (2-3 weeks)
- Basic Flask server setup
- Activity log viewer page
- Status display
- Simple configuration editing

### Phase 2: Failed Attempt Detection (1-2 weeks)
- Track failed attempts
- Implement detection algorithm
- Add security alert notifications

### Phase 3: Web Interface Enhancements (2-3 weeks)
- Add authentication
- Implement statistics and charts
- Improve UI/UX
- Mobile responsive design

### Phase 4: Webhook Support (if applicable) (1-2 weeks)
- Research and implement webhook capabilities
- Add push notification support

## Resources Required

- Flask and related dependencies
- Additional Python libraries for statistics and security features
- Web hosting for web interface
- Domain name for web interface (optional)
- SSL certificate for secure communication

## Future Considerations

- Mobile app development
- Integration with other smart home platforms
- Advanced anomaly detection using machine learning
- Multi-lock support improvements
- User permission systems
