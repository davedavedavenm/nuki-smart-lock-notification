# Milestone 1 - Functional Baseline

This commit marks the first milestone of the Nuki Smart Lock Notification System project - a functional baseline that successfully implements all core requirements:

- Connection to Nuki Web API
- Regular polling of the API for lock activity
- Notifications via both Telegram and email
- User identification in notifications
- Systemd service for auto-start on boot
- Modular code structure
- Web interface for monitoring and configuration
- Security pattern detection and alerting
- Dark mode implementation
- User management with authentication
- Customizable notification preferences
- GitHub repository setup
- Basic Docker implementation

The system is currently functional but requires cleanup and improvements to address technical debt, code organization, and various issues that have accumulated during rapid development.

This milestone serves as a reference point before beginning major refactoring and cleanup work. A complete backup has been saved in the milestone1_backup directory.
