# Nuki Smart Lock Notification System - Full Containerization Roadmap

This document outlines the steps to achieve a fully containerized and portable Nuki Smart Lock Notification System that can be deployed on any platform with minimal configuration.

## Current Containerization Status

The system currently has:
- ✅ Basic Docker images for web and monitor services
- ✅ Docker Compose configuration for orchestration
- ✅ Volume mapping for configuration persistence
- ✅ Working integration between services

## Containerization Roadmap

### Phase 1: Docker Compose Enhancement

1. **Volume Management Improvements**
   - [ ] Organize named volumes more efficiently
   - [ ] Add clear documentation for volume structure
   - [ ] Create backup/restore mechanisms for volumes

2. **Environment Variable Configuration**
   - [ ] Replace hardcoded values with environment variables
   - [ ] Create default `.env` file with sensible defaults
   - [ ] Document all available environment variables

3. **Container Health Checks**
   - [ ] Implement more robust health checks for all services
   - [ ] Add automatic recovery mechanisms
   - [ ] Implement proper startup order dependencies

4. **Security Enhancements**
   - [ ] Lock down container permissions
   - [ ] Implement proper secret management
   - [ ] Configure network isolation between services

### Phase 2: Bootstrapping Automation

1. **First-run Configuration**
   - [ ] Create initialization scripts for first-time setup
   - [ ] Generate default configurations automatically
   - [ ] Guide user through initial credentials setup

2. **Multi-platform Support**
   - [ ] Test on various Linux distributions
   - [ ] Ensure compatibility with macOS
   - [ ] Verify Windows functionality
   - [ ] Document platform-specific requirements

3. **Data Migration Tools**
   - [ ] Create tools to import existing configurations
   - [ ] Support migration from systemd to Docker
   - [ ] Create data validation and repair utilities

### Phase 3: Deployment Simplification

1. **One-click Deployment**
   - [ ] Create simplified deployment script
   - [ ] Add auto-detection of platform
   - [ ] Implement interactive setup wizard

2. **Update Mechanisms**
   - [ ] Create self-updating container system
   - [ ] Implement automatic backup before update
   - [ ] Add rollback mechanisms for failed updates

3. **Documentation**
   - [ ] Create platform-specific guides
   - [ ] Add troubleshooting section
   - [ ] Document common configuration scenarios
   - [ ] Create video tutorials for deployment

### Phase 4: Advanced Features

1. **CI/CD Pipeline**
   - [ ] Set up automated testing
   - [ ] Implement multi-architecture builds
   - [ ] Create automated releases

2. **Monitoring Integration**
   - [ ] Add built-in monitoring
   - [ ] Integrate with Prometheus/Grafana
   - [ ] Implement alert capabilities

3. **Scaling Capabilities**
   - [ ] Support for monitoring multiple locks
   - [ ] Add load balancing for larger deployments
   - [ ] Kubernetes manifest files for advanced users

## Implementation Priorities

For the next release, we will focus on:

1. **First-run Experience**
   - No-configuration startup with sensible defaults
   - Guided setup for API credentials
   - Automatic port detection and configuration

2. **Backup and Restore**
   - One-command backup solution
   - Easy restoration process
   - Automatic scheduled backups

3. **Cross-platform Testing**
   - Verify functionality on Raspberry Pi OS
   - Test on Windows, macOS, and popular Linux distributions
   - Document any platform-specific behaviors

## Contributing to Containerization

We welcome contributions to improve containerization:

1. Test in different environments and report issues
2. Suggest improvements to the Docker configuration
3. Help create platform-specific documentation
4. Develop and test migration tools

## Success Metrics

The containerization will be considered complete when:

1. New users can deploy with a single command on any platform
2. All configuration can be done through environment variables
3. System can recover automatically from most failure scenarios
4. Updates can be applied without manual intervention
5. Complete documentation covers all deployment scenarios

## Timeline

- **Phase 1**: 1-2 weeks
- **Phase 2**: 2-3 weeks
- **Phase 3**: 1-2 weeks
- **Phase 4**: Ongoing
