# Nuki Dashboard Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Configuration Saving Error
Fixed the error that occurred when saving configuration to "Telegram Only". The solution includes:
- Added proper error handling and validation for each configuration option
- Added a backup/restore mechanism for the config file
- Added validation to ensure notification_type is never empty
- Fixed file permissions after configuration updates
- Detailed logging of configuration changes

### 2. User Profile and Password Changes
Implemented the functionality to allow users to change their passwords:
- Added the `/api/profile` endpoint for password and theme updates
- Implemented proper validation and security checks for password changes
- Added logging for user profile changes

### 3. Dark Mode Styling Improvements
Enhanced the dark mode styling to fix contrast and consistency issues:
- Improved color contrast for text elements 
- Fixed navbar styling with proper hover and active states
- Added proper styling for forms, cards, and navigation elements
- Added styling for toast notifications and dashboard cards
- Fixed text color issues in various UI components

### 4. URL Routing Fix
Fixed a URL routing issue with the users_manage endpoint:
- Changed route from `/users/manage` to `/users_manage` to match the function name used in templates

## How to Apply These Changes

1. For local development:
```bash
cd C:\Users\Dave\OneDrive\Claude\NukiAppProject\consolidated_code
git add web/app.py
git add web/static/css/dark-mode.css
git add FIXES.md
git commit -m "Fix configuration saving, profile functionality, dark mode styling, and route issue"
git push origin main
```

2. For deployment on the Raspberry Pi:
```bash
# SSH into the Pi
ssh root@your-pi-ip

# Navigate to the project directory
cd /root/nukiweb

# Pull the latest changes
git pull

# Rebuild and restart the Docker containers
docker-compose down
docker-compose build --no-cache nuki-web
docker-compose up -d
```

## Testing the Changes

After deploying the changes, test the following functionality:
1. Change the notification type to "Telegram Only" and save the configuration
2. Navigate to the user profile page and try changing your password
3. Toggle between light and dark mode to verify the styling improvements
4. Access the user management page to confirm the URL routing is fixed

All these changes should work together to provide a more stable and visually consistent application.
