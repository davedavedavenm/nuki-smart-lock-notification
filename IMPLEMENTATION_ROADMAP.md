## Tracking and Coordination

For each task:
1. Create an issue in GitHub
2. Use branches named by phase/module (e.g., `phase1/docker-config`)
3. Submit pull requests with detailed descriptions
4. Update this roadmap with progress

Regular check-ins will be scheduled to track progress and address any issues that arise during implementation.

## Next Steps

After completing this cleanup project, consider these future enhancements:

1. Add support for multiple smart locks with separate notifications
2. Implement advanced analytics and reporting
3. Create a mobile app for remote monitoring
4. Add integration with home automation systems
5. Implement multi-factor authentication for the web interface
