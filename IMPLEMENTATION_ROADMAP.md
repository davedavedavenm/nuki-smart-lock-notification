## Implementation Priority Focus (Next Sprint)

### Critical Tasks (P0)
1. Create data models in `app/models/` - Foundation for validation and authentication
   - User models implementation
   - Activity data structures
   - Temporary code handling

### High Priority Tasks (P1)
1. Improve authentication handling once user models are complete
2. Implement proper data validation mechanisms
3. Extract route handlers for better modularity
4. Set up testing framework for quality assurance

## Tracking and Coordination

For each task:
1. Create an issue in GitHub
2. Use branches named by phase/module (e.g., `phase2/data-models`)
3. Submit pull requests with detailed descriptions
4. Update this roadmap with progress

Regular check-ins will be scheduled to track progress and address any issues that arise during implementation.

## Next Steps

After completing this cleanup project, consider these future enhancements:

1. Add support for multiple smart locks with separate notifications
2. Implement advanced analytics and reporting
3. Create a mobile app for remote monitoring
4. Add integration with home automation systems
5. Implement multi-factor authentication for the web interface
